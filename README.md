## Installation
We'll be using Python 3, Jupyter (JUlia + PYThon +R = Jupyter) Notebooks, and Pandas to analyze the Titanic passenger log. The easiest way to install all of these on your local computer, that's your laptop or desktop, is using Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Python updates a lot and the code that Python depends on also changes a lot. Anaconda helps to keep some of those changes stable. For this session I used:
conda install plotnine
conda install pandas

But your installation might be different than mine!
