NOTE to contributors. These are the lessons and content from previous workshops. You should feel free to

* PRUNE heavily
* ADD your own flare
* Improve by providing better analogies
* Improve by adding more formative assessments
* Improve by giving them more practice exercises
* Improve by shortening lessons and sticking to the basics to keep with the time constraints
* Improve the rhythm and flow by adding more breaks

Do not deviate from the Software Carpentry pedagogy. Work closely with your workshop mentors.
